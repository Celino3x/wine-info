# WINE API

If you're passionate about wine, you'd like to learn more about the wonderful world of single notes. This API will help by providing important information such as: *Harvest, Ideal temperature for consumption and Harmonization*.


# Challenges and Development

I learned in this project to improve the layout of the forms and the final display through tables. My challenge, silly as it was, was to organize the directories in a way that was easy to maintain.

## Create files and folders

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## How are they organized

The index.php file displays a direct **SELECT** from the **MySQL** database. The *_cadastrar_vinho.php* file has the functionality to include the typed data about the wine in the database, followed by _inserir_vinho.php uses **POST** and converts the photo with a new name and format.

All **HEAD** and **FOOTER** of the pages are provided by the following path:

 - \page\_footer.php 
 - \page\_header.php

The registered photos are stored in the *foto_wines* directory.

## Database

The Database is available in the **db** directory..
